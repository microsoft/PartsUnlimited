### Task 1: Create and Configure Azure Devops environment
Our first task is to create an Azure DevOps project. To do this you will need an Azure DevOps account. If you have an existing Azure DevOps account you can use that and just create a new project, as outlined from step 3 below.

1. If you do not have an Azure DevOps (formerly known as Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS)) account, you can sign up for a free account by going to <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">http://visualstudio.com</span></a>. Then, under **Azure DevOps (formerly VSTS)** section click the **Get Started for free** link.

5. Click on the **Agent job 1** section, click the  **+** button to add a task, click on **Build** and scroll down to find the **Gradle**  task. Then, click the **Add** button three times next to the Gradle task to add three Gradle tasks to the build pipeline. Gradle will be used to build the Integration Service, Order Service, and Clients components of the MRP app.

    ![Screenshot of the Add tasks build task options with Gradle highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-secandcompliancewhitesource\secandcomp10.png) 


6.  Select the first Gradle task and set the below values, leaving any items not mentioned as their default values.

    - Display name: **IntegrationService**
    - gradle wrapper: **src/Backend/IntegrationService/gradlew** (either type or browse using the **...** button)
    - Working Directory: **src/Backend/IntegrationService** (either type or browse using the **...** button)
    - JUnit Test Results: **uncheck** the checkbox to **Publish to Azure Pipelines/TFS**, since we will not be running automated tests in the Integration Service. 

    ![Screenshot of the first gradle task with the field values mentioned configured and highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-secandcompliancewhitesource\secandcomp11.png) 


7. Select the first Gradle task and set the below values, leaving any items not mentioned as their default values.

    - Display name: **OrderService**
    - gradle wrapper: **src/Backend/OrderService/gradlew** (either type or browse using the **...** button)
    - Working Directory: **src/Backend/OrderService**(either type or browse using the **...** button)
    - JUnit Test Results: **check** the checkbox to **Publish to Azure Pipelines/TFS** , and set the **Test Results Files** field to `**/TEST-*.xml`.  Since the Order Service **does** have unit tests in the project, we can automate running the tests as part of the build by adding in a `test` in the **Gradle tasks** field.

    ![Screenshot of the second gradle task with the field values mentioned configured and highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-secandcompliancewhitesource\secandcomp12.png) 

8. Select the first Gradle task and set the below values, leaving any items not mentioned as their default values.

11. Select the first **Copy Files to:** task, and fill in the listed fields with the below values, leaving any items not mentioned with their default values.


    - Source Folder: **$(Build.SourcesDirectory)\src** (either type or browse using the **...** button to go to src)
    - Contents: **/build/libs/!(buildSrc)*.?ar
    - Target Folder: **$(build.artifactstagingdirectory)\drop**


    ![Screenshot of the first copy files task with the fields mentioned highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-secandcompliancewhitesource\secandcomp16.png) 

    - **Note**: We will copy the files we want from the build and repo and place them in a staging area on the agent, to be later picked up from there and published as build pipeline artifacts which we can later use in our release pipeline. To view more details about the variables that we are using in the tasks you can take a lok at the page 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/build/variables?view=vsts" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">Predefined build variables</span></a>

12. Select the second **Copy Files to:** task, and fill in the listed fields with the below values, leaving any items not mentioned with their default values.

	- Contents:	 **/deploy/SSH-MRP-Artifacts.ps1
				**/deploy/deploy_mrp_app.sh
				**/deploy/MongoRecords.js
	- Target Folder: $(build.artifactstagingdirectory)

    ![Screenshot of the second copy files task with the fields mentioned highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-secandcompliancewhitesource\secandcomp17.png) 

    -**Note**: Try to get the formatting as it appears in the screenshot to ensure the task works smoothly. Ultimately when you check the build artifacts at the end of the lab, you will know if the task is working correctly or not and can troubleshoot or amend as you need.

13. Select the first **Publish Artifact** task, and fill in the listed fields with the below values, leaving any items not mentioned with their default values.


    - Path to publish: **$(build.artifactstagingdirectory)\drop**

    - Artifact publish location: **Azure Pipelines/TFS**

    ![Screenshot of the first Publish Artifacttask with the fields mentioned highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-secandcompliancewhitesource\secandcomp18.png) 

    - **Note**: In these publish tasks, we are taking the items from the agent staging area and publishing them as build pipeline artifacts for later use in our release pipeline. We will not create and deploy using our release pipeline in this lab but if you wish you may retain this build pipeline for your own testing and use later.

14. Select the second **Publish Artifact** task, and fill in the input values with the following:


    - Path to publish: **$(build.artifactstagingdirectory)\deploy**
    - Artifact Name: **deploy**
    - Artifact publish location: **Azure Pipelines/TFS**

    ![Screenshot of the second Publish Artifact task with the fields mentioned highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-secandcompliancewhitesource\secandcomp19.png) 

15. Click **Save and Queue**, and then select **Save and Queue** from the drop down options to save the build pipeline and trigger a manual build, and in the Save build pipeline and queue dialogue click **Save & queue** again.
