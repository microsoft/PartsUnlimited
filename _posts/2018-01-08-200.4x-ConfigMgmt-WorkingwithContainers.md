### Task 1: Install Docker Client on Your Machine

In this exercise, you will install Docker client on your machine. If you are performing the steps in an Azure virtual machine with Docker already installed you can move to the next exercise.

If you wish to use an Azure virtual machine <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/nested-virtualization-in-azure/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc"> nested virtualization is supported in Azure</span></a> using <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-the-new-dv3-and-ev3-vm-sizes/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc"> Dv3 and Ev3 virtual machines sizes.</span></a>



This exercise is intended for scenarios where your environment does not already have Docker available in your windows environment.

If you are performing these steps in your local windows environment you do not need a Microsoft Azure subscription for this first exercise, but you will need one for the subsequent exercises.


1. Navigate to the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc"> Install Docker</span></a> page and quickly familiarise yourself with what options are available for installing Docker. You can choose an appropriate option for you and your environment, but we will use the Docker Community Edition (CE) and our steps below will be based around Windows, you can install docker and follow the steps in your Linux or macOS environment also if you wish.

2. Navigate to <a href="https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc"> Docker Community Edition download page</span></a>, locate your operating system i.e. **Docker CE For Windows** and click the **Download from Docker Store**  link.

    
3. On the  <a href="https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc"> Docker Commnunity Edition for Windows</span></a>, page, click the **Get Docker CE for Windows (stable)** button, we will use the stable version and follow the prompts to complete the installation. You may need to restart to complete the depending on your installation.


    ![Docker CE for Windows(stable)](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\DockerCEforwindows.png)




4. Once docker is installed, open a **command prompt** and run the below command and verify help command options are returned. 

    **Note:** The commands that we will run through in the following steps, will be the same in Windows, Linux or macOS.

    ```
    docker 
    ```
    ![Docker cmd output](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\docker.png)

5. Run the below command and verify it returns version information. It should return the client and server details for version, API version, GO version, Git commit, date built and OS/Architecture

    ```
    docker version 
    ```
    ![Docker version cmd output](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerversion.png)

6. Run the below command and verify it returns just the version information

    ```
    docker --version 
    ```

    ![Docker--version cmd output](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\docker--version.png)

7. Run the below command to get the docker compose version. Docker-compose allows you write .yml files to configure an application’s services in your containers.

    ```
    docker-compose --version 
    ```
    
    ![Docker compose cmd output](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockercomposever.png)

8. Run the below command  to get the docker machine version. Docker machine allows you to manage host machines

    ```
    docker-machine -- version 
    ```
    
    ![Docker machine cmd output](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockermachine-ver.png)


9. Run the below command. This will return various information about number of containers, running, images, architecture, and various settings. Scroll through them to get a feeling for what the individual elements are referring to.

    ```
    docker info
    ```
    ![Docker machine cmd output](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerinfo.png)







### Task 2: Run a docker container on Windows

In this exercise, you will run a container to demonstrate the concept of immutability with containers.


1. Verify that docker is correctly installed by running the command below to see what containers are present on the system. If it is a new installatio an dno containers have been run previously, there will  be none listed, as in the screenshot.

    ```
    docker ps -a
    ```
    
    ![Docker version cmd output](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerpsdasha.png)



2. Start by running a simple windows container with the command prompt, cmd.exe, running in it, by running the following command:

    ```
    docker run -it microsoft/windowsservercore cmd
    ```

    A new command window will open which is running inside the container. The context in which the cmd window is running will indicate it is running inside the container with the command you have just run, as in the screenshot below.

    ![Docker version cmd output](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\cmdinsidecontainer1.png)

    
    - **Potential Errors and Issues:**
        - If you receive a message saying something like *image operating system "windows" cannot be used on this platform"*, your docker installation may be set to run Linux containers and you need to switch it to windows, to be able to successfully run windows containers. (or vice versa)

        ![Docker version cmd output](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerrunwindowserror.png)

        Do this by going to the system tray, selecting the arrow, locating the **docker** icon, right clicking it and choosing **switch to Linux containers...**

        ![Docker system tray](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerinsystray.png)


        ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\switchtowindowscontainersmenu.png)

        This may take a minute or so to switch, you can verify it is switched by checking that the message in the menu, now prompts to switch to Linux containers i.e. the opposite to what it was

        ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\switchtolinuxcontainers.png)
            
    - If you receive an error message saying something like *..encountered and error during CreateContainer: failure in a Windows system call:....virtual hard disk files must be run uncompressed and unencrypted and must not be sparse......*  this may be due to the disk where the container is trying to run, being compressed or encrypted. You will need to uncompress or unencrypt the disk to allow the container to run on that disk.
     
        ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\encryptionrunerror.png)




3. Inside the command prompt in the newly started container run the following commands in sequence, to view the directory contents, create a directory called **demo**, then go inside of the new **demo** directory


    ```
    dir 
    md demo 
    cd demo 
    ```
        
    ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\cntrcmd_mdcddemo.png)


4. Create a new file called **myfile.txt** and add some text, press **Enter** after you type the text, and then exit the *copy con* command and copy the file by running the below commands

    ```
    copy con myfile.txt 
    Hello this is in my docker container 
    ```

    press **Enter** then exit the command by pressing the below keys

    ```
    ctrl+c 
    ```
    
    ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\cntrcmd_copycon.png)


5. Verify the newly created file is present by running the command

    ```
    dir
    ```
    ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\cntrcmd_dir2.png)



6. Exit the container by running the command

    ```
    ctrl + q
    ```

    If this is not working for you try the command sequence **ctrl + p + q** (holding down the ctrl key while pressing p and then q in sequence.)
    You should retrun to a command prompt and the header in the command prompt window should no longer have the docker command. 

    **Note:** this command exits the container but leaves it running.

7. When back on the host run the following command

    ```
    docker ps
    ```


    Now you should see a container running with a generated name. Note the name for use in later steps. If you have run containers previously and they are still running in your environment they may also be listed, but the below screenshot only has one listed.

    ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerpscmd.png)


8. Verify that you don’t see the file you created earlier, **myfile.txt** on your host by going to the **C:** directory and running the command 

    ```
    dir
    ```

    ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\OSDisk.png)


9. Stop the container by running the below command 

    ```
    docker stop <name-of-the-container> 
    ```

    or

    ```
    docker stop <container ID> 
    ```

    (the name or contianer ID can be obtained from running the **docker ps** command. 
    
    Also, note that you only need to provide the first two digits of the container ID for the command to run successfully, once it is a unique ID value you do not need to provide the whole ID.)


10. Now run the below commands to view the running containers, and then view all containers, including stopped containers.

    ```
    docker ps 
    docker ps -a 
    ```
    
    ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerpsa.png)


11. Now launch a container with the cmd.exe running as was done earlier, by rnuning the below command again.

    ```
    docker run -it microsoft/windowsservercore cmd
    ```

12. Inside the running container command prompt window container run the command

    ```
    dir
    ```

    ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockercmddir.png)


13. Verify that the folder and file your created earlier, i.e. **myfile.txt** is **not**  present.

This demonstrates the immutability, or unchanging nature, of containers i.e. every time we start a container we get a new fresh copy and the changes that were made to it while it was running previously are not present in this new running instance.

You should exit the docker container by typing **exit** when you are finished. You can also run the commands **docker ps** and **docker ps –a** to view the currently running and all containers that have run.

 
### Task 3: Build a new Container Image

In this exercise, you will go through the steps of creating a new Container image, firstly from the command line using Docker commit, and then using a docker file and the docker build command. You can also view similar related tasks by watching the course demos in Module 1 > Lesson 3 - Containers and Docker. 

#### Create a container image using steps on the command-line

1. In the command line ensure that docker is installed and then run the command 

    ```
    docker run -it --name mycontainername microsoft/windowsservercore cmd
    ```

2. In the running container window run the following commands, to create a folder and .txt file in the container, enter some text into the .txt file, press **Enter** after typing the text, type **ctrl+c** to exit the **copy con** command and then exit the container.

    ```
    md builddemo 
    cd builddemo 
    copy con myfile.txt 
    This is a text file 
    ```

    press **ctrl + C** to exit the *copy con* command, then exit the container by running the command

    ```
    exit
    ```

    **Note:** Windows does not support the committing of a running container to an image so we need to exit, by typing **exit** and not typing **ctrl + p + q** which leaves the container running.

    ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\cntrcmds1.png)


3. Back in the command line, view the containers by running the command

    ```
    docker ps -a
    ```

    If the container is still running, stop it by using the command

    ```
    docker stop <imagename> 
    ```
    ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerpsandstop1.png)

4. Create an image for the container you just created by running the command 

    ```
    docker commit <mycontainername> <mycontainerimagename>
    ```
    
    ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockercommit.png)

5. View the available images by running the command

    ```
    docker images
    ```

    ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerimages.png)

6. View a list of the containers, remove the earlier container that you commited to an image and verify it has been deleted by running the commands 

    ```
    docker ps –a 
    docker rm <mycontainername> 
    docker ps –a 
    ```

    **Note:** if you have a large number of containers on your system, they can use up a significant amount of space, if you wish to delet them all you can use the `docker system prune` command, more details are available on the docker docs page <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/system_prune/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">docker system prune </span></a>. 
    
    Be aware though that this wil also remove networking and other docker configurations, so be careful if deciding to use it that you understand the implications. If you only have a few images to remove perhaps using **docker rm <container ID>** is an easier optoin for you.


7. Now run a container based on the same container that you ran earlier, in step 1, i.e. using the same container name < mycontainername>, and verify the folder you created earlier is not present in the container, i.e. all changes were not retained in the container, and then exit the container. 

    ```
    docker run -it --name < mycontainername > microsoft/windowsservercore cmd 
    dir 
    exit
    ```

    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerimagename.png)

8. Now run your newly created container image by running the command 

    ```
    docker run -it < mycontainerimagename > cmd 
    dir
    ```
    
    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockercontsinerimagefolder.png)

9. Verify the **builddemo** folder you created earlier is present in the image you created. You can open the text file within this folder to verify it is the same file if you wish. 

    This demonstrates that changes made within containers can be retained by committing the container to an image.


#### <span style="color: #0000CD;">Create a container image using the docker build file and spin up a container website</span>

Firstly, you will need to create some files that you will need, Dockerfile and index.html.

1. Create the Dockerfile by creating a folder on your local drive **C:\Dockerfile**

2. In this folder, create a new .txt file and copy or type in the following, in the format below, each in a new line.

    ```script
    FROM microsoft/iis
    WORKDIR /inetpub/wwwroot
    ADD index.html index.html
    ```
    
    as in the screenshot below

    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerfilecreate1.png)


3. Save the file with no extension, with the name **Dockerfile**
    - The first line in the file is the base image we will use
    - The second line sets a working directory in the container of /inetpub/wwwroot
    - The third line, then adds a file, index.html, to that directory


    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerfile1.png)

4. Still in this folder create a new file called Index.html file, then open the file in notepad and copy or type in the following text. When finished Save the file.

    ```html
    <html>
    <head>
    <title>my html page in a container</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    Welcome to my html page in a docker container
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\indexhtmlfile.png)

4. You should now have a folder **C:\Dockerfile** containing two files, as below, that contain the above content.
    - Dockerfile
    - Index.html

    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\indexhtml2.png)

    Now we will go ahead and build our container image using the newly created files and the docker build command

5. In the command prompt window go to **C:\Dockerfile** folder by typing

    ```
    cd dockerfile
    ```

    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerfilecmd1.png)

6. Build the image by running the following command in the command line from within the folder you created earlier that contains the files i.e. **C:\Dockerfile**

    **Note:** do not forget the ‘ . ‘ at the end of the below command, this specifies the context in which it needs to build the image, which is the folder you are in.

    ```
    docker build -t < container image name i.e. something like iiscntr1 > .
    ```

    It may take 10 minutes or so to complete and the image should be built successfully

    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerbuild2.png)




3. View the image you just built by running the command

    ```
    docker images
    ```
    
    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerimages2.png)


4. Now run the image by running the following command

    ```
    docker run -d -p 8080:80 < iiscntr1 >
    ```

    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerrun2.png)

    **Note:** If you get the error message **failed to create endpoint < container name> on network nat: HNS failed with error : The process cannot access the file because itis being used by another process.**, as in the screenshot below. This is most likely due to a port you specified already being used by another process. change the port numbers listed above to another port value 80:80 or 8081:80 etc

     ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerrun_error1.png)


5. View the running container by running the following command, and note the container ID for use in the next step.

    ```
    docker ps
    ```

    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerps3.png


6. Obtain the IP address for the container by running the following command

    ```
    Docker inspect <container ID>
    ```


    Note: You do not need to type the full container ID, you only need to enter the first two or three characters.

    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerinspect1.png)



7. Scroll through the output and under **Networks** > Locate the **IPAddress** value


    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerinspect2.png)

8. Open a browser and go to the IP address you noted in the previous step i.e. type  **http://172.19.41.238**, or what your IPAddress value is for your container.


9. You should see the new website running on port **8080** serving the **index.htm** file that is in the current folder

    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\webbrowser1.png)



#### <span style="color: #0000CD;">Scale out your container websites</span>

We will quickly scale out our container web sites, to demonstrate how quickly it is to csale using containers.

1. Start new containers based off your earlier image, by running the following command three times, each time incrementing the container port value, the 80 is the host port value.

    ```
    docker run -d -p 8081:80 < iiscntr1 >
    ```

    then

    ```
    docker run -d -p 8082:80 < iiscntr1 >
    ```
    
    then
    
    ```
    docker run -d -p 8083:80 < iiscntr1 >
    ```

    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerrunscale1.png)

2. Get a list of the running containers and note their container IDs

    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerrunscale2.png)

3. Obtain the **IP Address** values for each running container by running the following command, and noting the values listed for each container individually.


    ```
    Docker inspect <container ID>
    ```


    The IP Address values will all be different, the values on our containers are below
    - 172.19.42.161
    - 172.19.39.17
    - 172.19.42.109

4. Open up a web browser and go to each page i.e. **http://IPAddress-Value**, you should have 

    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerrunscale3.png)

    In a few steps we have very quickly spun up three additinal instances of our container web page. This demonstrates how quickly container can be scaled, in comparison to virtual machines they start up very quickly. This is one of the reasons for the popularity and interest in containers.

#### <span style="color: #0000CD;">Scale down your container websites</span>

1. Stop the running containers by running the command for each container

    ```
    Docker stop <container ID>
    ```
    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerscale4.png)


2. Return to the web browser and refresh it, and verify the container web pages are no longer available.


    ```
    docker stop <image name>. 
    ```

    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerrunscale5.png)

    We have very quickly scaled down our container web pages.

    We can quite quickly and easily scale our website and have as many instances as we wish running wihtin minutes and equally can quite quickly scale them back down again.
    

    **NOTE:** Do **not** delete the image as we will use this in later exercises. Also, failure to stop the image may result in some errors in later exercises.


 

### Task 4:  Create a repository with Azure Container Registry and Push a customized container image to it.

In this exercise, you will create an Azure Container Registry, and then push a previously created container image to the Azure Container Registry.

#### <span style="color: #0000CD;">Create and connect to an Azure Container Registry</span>

1. Sign into your Azure subscription at http://portal.azure.com, 

2. In Azure click **Create a resource** type **registry**, and locate **Azure Container Registry** service and in the Azure Container Registry blade, click **Create**

    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\acr1.png)


3. Use the values
    - Registry name: **acrek1** (it must be a unique name)
    - Subscription: **< your own subscription >**
    - Resource group: **Create new** > **acrek1_rg**
    - Location: **< data center location nearest to you >**
    - Admin User: **enable**
    - SKU: **Basic**
    And click **Create** when finished entering the above.


    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\acr2.png)


    Note: Details on the SKU pricing and capabilities are available <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/container-registry/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc"> here</span></a>

4.  Open your newly created container registry service.
    
    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\acr3.png)

5. Go to Access keys and copy down the following details to use when setting up the
    - Registry name: **acrek1** (it must be a unique name)
    - Login server: **< it should look something like this, acrek1.azurecr.io >**
    - Username: **acrek1**
    - Password: **<it should look something like this, `nzflMvymzne=HLgv2xUjy0tD7h7KDyZl`>**

    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\acr4.png)

6. Verify you can connect from the command line by running the command

    ```
    Docker login –u <user name i.e. acrek1> -p < password i.e. something like nzflMvymzne=HLgv2xUjy0tD7h7KDyZl > <Login server i.e. acr12.azurecr.io >
    ```

    You should receive a Login Succeeded message.

    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\acr5.png)


    However, the message tells us that using the parameter ***-p** to supply the  password, is inscecure. By using this method to pass the password it may be accessible via the shell's history or log files. The message prompts us to use the  **--password-stdin** parameter which is considered more secure. To achieve this we would need to pass the password as a variable in a credential store or encrypted file, and then call that variable when running the docker login command. It could be done a number of ways but we will not do that in this lab. There are more details on how to provide a password using STDIN available <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#provide-a-password-using-stdin" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc"> Here</span></a>


#### <span style="color: #0000CD;">Push a customized container image to an Azure Container Registry</span>

1. Still logged into you Azure Container Registry service, from the command line run the command

    ```
    docker images
    ```
    
    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\acr6.png)


    You should see an image that you created earlier, named `iiscntr1`, or whatever you named it in Task 3.

2. Tag your container image and prefix it with the name of your Azure Container Registry by running the command

    ```
    docker tag <image name i.e. iiscntr1 > < registry login server i.e. acrek1.azurecr.io>/ <image name i.e. iiscntr1>
    ```

    The command should look something like the below

    ```
    docker tag iiscntr1 acrek1.azurecr.io/iiscntr1
    ```
    
    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\acr7.png)

    **NOTE:** If you do **not** prefix the image with your container registry name, you will not be able to push it to your container registry.

    Further details are available on the docker tags command for tagging images on the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/tag/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc"> docs.docker.com site</span></a> site.


3. Verify the image has been tagged correctly by running the below command.

    ```
    docker images < new image full repository and image name i.e. something like acrek1.azurecr.io/iiscntr1>
    ```

    The command should look something like the below

    ```
    docker images acrek1.azurecr.io/iiscntr1
    ```
    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\acr8.png)

    **Note:** It will have the same hash ID value as the original image, but will just be tagged differently, as in the screenshot above.

4. Now push the image to your Azure Container Registry by running the command

    ```
    docker push acrek1.azurecr.io/iiscntr1
    ```
    
    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\acr9.png)

5. Open your **Azure Container Registry** service in the azure portal and go to **Repositories**, and verify the image is now listed under repositories. Verify it also has the **latest** tag associated with it.

    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\acr10.png)

    **NOTE:** Do **not** delete image or the **Azure Container Registry** service, as it will be used in a subsequent lab task.




### Task 5: Using docker-compose to orchestrate multiple containers

In this task, we will use the **docker-compose** command to orchestrate the creation of two container instances, i.e. one to host the PartsUnlimited website and one to host the SQL database for the PartsUnlimited website. The website container will have a dependency on the db container, so the **docker-compose** command will orchestrate the timing of the container creation.


**Note:** In order to create the ParstUnlimited website, we will need the website aplication build files. These can be sourced from a couple of different locations or sources. 
- **You can use your own generated web app build artifact files:** If you have complete the lab <a href="http://microsoft.github.io/PartsUnlimited/cicd/200.3x-CICD-M01-CIwithVSTS.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc"> Continuous Integration with VSTS </span></a>, the website build files are available in the generated build artifact `drop`, that is created in that lab. Just download this `drop.zip` build artifact and use that.  
- **You can use pre-generated build artifact files:** Go to the PartsUnlimited github repo location <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimited/tree/master/Labfiles/Artifacts/PartsUnlimited" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">PartsUnlimited/Labfiles/Artifacts/PartsUnlimited</span></a> and download the `drop.zip` from there. This has been generated in VSTS using the PartsUnlimited source files. We will use these files as our source in the following steps.


#### <span style="color: #0000CD;">Setup your file and folder structure for the docker-compose orchestration</span>

These steps will walk through how to structure your environment to allow you run the docker-compose successfully


1. Create a local folder **C:\dclab\src**. i.e. have the **src** folder within the **dclab** folder. 

2. Obtain the PartsUnlimited web site build artifact files by going to the PartsUnlimited github repo location <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimited/tree/master/Labfiles/Artifacts/PartsUnlimited" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">PartsUnlimited/Labfiles/Artifacts/PartsUnlimited</span></a>, download the `drop.zip` from there and extract its contents into the **src** folder.

    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dcpuwebappsrcfiles.png)

    These are the web site files for the PartsUnlimited web site. You can use your own generated drop buld artifact files if you have created them already in the earlier <a href="http://microsoft.github.io/PartsUnlimited/cicd/200.3x-CICD-M01-CIwithVSTS.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc"> Continuous Integration with VSTS </span></a>

3. Obtain the **docker-compose** and **Dockerfile** files by going to the PartsUnlimited github repo location <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimited/tree/master/Labfiles/Devops200.4x-ConfigMgmtForContainerizedDelivery/M01/Labs" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">PartsUnlimited/Labfiles/Devops200.4x-ConfigMgmtForContainerizedDelivery/M01/Labs/</span></a> and download the files

    - Dockerfile
    - docker-compose.override.yml
    - docker-compose.yml


    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\pudockercomposefiles.png)


4. Place the docker-compose and dockerfile files, into the **C:\dclab** folder

    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockercomposefilesinexplorer.png)


5. Familiarise yourself with the contents of the three docker files. 

    - Open the **docker-compose.yml** file 

        ```
        version: '3'

        services:
            partsunlimitedwebsite:
                image: partsunlimitedwebsite
                build:
                    context: .
                    dockerfile: Dockerfile

        ```

        - This file is calling the dockerfile to build the web site container. The following points are of note:
        
            - all paths are relative to the docker-compose files location and we specify the `.` in the context instruction, to indicate the dockerfile is in the same folder as the docker-compose.yml file
            - the yml file can define <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#service-configuration-reference" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">services</span></a>, <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#network-configuration-reference" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">networks</span></a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#volume-configuration-reference" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">volumes</span></a>, in the case here we define a service which is the web site container.
            - The build definition for this container is defined in the **Dockerfile**, which it calls here.

    - Open the **docker-compose.override.yml** file

        ```
        version: '3'

        services:
            partsunlimitedwebsite:
                environment:
                    - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
                    - ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnectionString=Server=db;Initial Catalog=PartsUnlimited;Integrated Security=False;User ID=sa;Password=P@ssw0rd0123!;
                ports:
                - "80"    
                depends_on:
                - db
            
            db:
                image: microsoft/mssql-server-windows-developer
                expose:
                    - "1433"
                environment:
                    ACCEPT_EULA: 'Y'
                    sa_password: 'P@ssw0rd0123!'


        networks:
            default:
                external:
                name: nat
        ```

        - This file is building the db container and the network, it is also providing for additional configuration for the partsunlimitedwebsite container. The following points are of note:
        
           - Use of multiple compose files allows us to customise an application for different environments i.e. we could have different override yml files, one each for **Dev**, **Test**, **Production** etc and they could all run on top of the same **docker-compose.yml** which would outline the base configuration across all environments. 
           - The override file configuration overrides or adds to cofiguration defined in the **docker-compose.yml**
           - The override file specifies two containers to use **partsunlimitedwebsite:** and **db:**
           - the image to use for the **db:** container is called out here as it wasn't defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
           - we define the network in this override file as it also wasn't defined in the docker-compose.yml file.






    - Open the **dockerfile**

        ```
        FROM microsoft/aspnetcore:2.0
        ARG source
        WORKDIR /app
        EXPOSE 80
        COPY ${source:-src\PartsUnlimited} .
        ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "PartsUnlimitedWebsite.dll"]
        ```

        - This file is building the partsunlimitedwebsite container. The following points are of note: 
        
           - uses the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">FROM</span></a> instruction to call the image **microsoft\aspnetcore2.0**.
           - defines the variable source using the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">ARG</span></a> instruction.
           - specifies a directory **/app** to work in using the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#workdir" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">WORKDIR</span></a> instruction, for any other commands that are run.
           - opens port 80 to listen on using the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#expose" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc"> EXPOSE </span></a> instruction.

           - Uses the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">COPY</span></a> command to copy the PartsUnlimited website files to the container.
           - uses the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">ENTRYPOINT</span></a> command to execute the dotnet.exe and specifies the parameter PartsUnliitedwebsite.dll to be used with the command. Note that there is a difference between the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21553353/what-is-the-difference-between-cmd-and-entrypoint-in-a-dockerfile" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">ENTRYPOINT and CMD</span></a> commands


#### <span style="color: #0000CD;">Build multiple container environments using docker-compose </span>

1. open up a command prompt in the folder where you have your docker files and website source files copied i.e. **C:\dclab** 


    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dclab1.png)



2. Run the below command



    ```
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up
    ```

    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dclab3.png)
    
    
    The use of the **-f** switch allows us specify multiple compose files. The command window display real time log output

    - **Potential errors and issues:**
    
        - If you receive errors when running the docker-compose build command, such as 

            ```
            Service 'web' failed to build: failed to register layer: re-exec error: exit status 1: output: remove ….
            ```
            - try the following 
                - ensure you have enough space to download and extract the images, 
                - ensure that the IIS image you ran earlier in this lab task has been stopped. 
                - You could also download the images separately, so they are available locally already.

        - If you receive an error related to not being able to access the virtual machine when running the `docker-compose up` command, wait for a few minutes and retry the command. 


4. Start a new command prompt to inspect the running containers and run the following command to determine the IP Address of the parstunlimted website container

    ```
    docker ps
    ```

    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dclab4.png)
    

5. Note the container ID of the partsunlimited web site container, and determine the IP Address of the website by running the below command and scrolling through the output to obtain the IPAddress value in the **Networks** section.

    ```
    docker inspect  < container ID>
    ```

    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dclab5.png)


    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dclab6.png)



7. Open a web browser and enter the IP address in the addres bar **http://< Container IP Address >**


    **Important Note:** There is currently an issue with the ParstUnlimited web site application for which an update is required. As such you will receive the page as in the screen shot below, which is prompting to apply migrations to the db.

    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dclab7.png)

    This is caused by changing the password before the website calls in the container the first time, and the root cause is in the Parts Unlimited code. There, the startup code should be resilient when connecting to the database not being available, and it should retry it until it works with progressive backoff on the retry. E.g. by using the poly nugetpackage, so it is the default migrations mechanism that is the problem and it is not related to the container configuration. The parts unlimted web site does not do any retries and fails. An update to the app to resolve this is pending.

    However, we can get the web site up and running by completing the following steps.

8. in the second command prompt window where you ran the **docker ps** and **docker** inspect cpommands run the following command

    ```
    docker stop  < partsunlimted website container ID >
    ```


    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dclab8.png)


9. Now remove the web site container by running the command

    ```
    docker rm  < partsunlimted website container ID >
    ```


    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dclab9.png)


10. Ensure you are in the folder where your **docker-compose** files are located i.e. **C:\dclab** and now build the website container again by runing the docker-compose up command as below


    ```
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up
    ```

    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dclab10.png)



11. Open another new command prompt windows and obtain the container ID of the partsunlimited web site container by running the command


    ```
    docker ps
    ```

    The website container ID will be different to the previous contianer ID as it is a new instance, where as the db container ID will be the same as before, as it is the same container instance.

12. Obtain the IPAddress value of the website container by running the below command and scrolling to the **Networks** section


    ```
    docker inspect  < container ID>
    ```

    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dclab12.png)


    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dclab13.png)



13. Open a web browser and enter the IP address in the addres bar **http://< Container IP Address >**


    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dclab14.png)


    PartsUnlimted is now up and running and accessible in the container


14. If you wish, to verify the db: container is up and running successfully, you can connect to the db container by running the following commands from the command prompt window, you can obtain the **db:** container ID using the **docker ps** command as before. If you do not wish to check the db you can proceed directly to step 17.


    ```
    docker exec -it < container ID > sqlcmd -S. -Usa
    ```
    
15: Enter the password when prompted, it is available in the **docker-compose.override.yml** i.e. **P@ssw0rd0123!**

16. Run a TSQL command as below, and verify you get a successful output of the 

    ```
    select @@version
    go
    ```

    and then

    
    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dclab15.png)

    and then run the command to list all databases

    ```
    sp_databases
    go
    ```


    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dclab16.png)

    then type exit to return 

    You could run additional queries or commands using  
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sqlcmd-utility?view=sql-server-2017" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">sqlcmd</span></a>, or alternatively you could connect to your db container using SQL Management Studio or some other db management tools. It is a fully functional db. Type **exit** to return to the command prompt when you are finished.



17. Take down the web and database containers by ensuring you are in the folder where your Dockerfile is located i.e. **C:\dclab** and running the command docker-compose down as below


    ```
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml down
    ```

    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dclab17.png)




18. Verify the containers are no longer running.
